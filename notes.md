# Playing Busy Lowest

# Notes
- Look at early hand and choose species to focus on

Draw:
- Are any of the discarded cards helpful in defense or attack?
Play:
- rainbow-chain:
    - Make a chain of 1-8 
    - different species to throw off opponent/stay adaptable
- Only play cards you can afford to
Discard:
- Discard cards you don't mind them having

Keeping track of cards:
- Species, your hand score, their known hand score, remaining score, playAreaScore, opponentPlayAreaScore
- Which cards can you afford to get rid of?
    - Cards where your hand score - (their hand score + remaining + card) > 0
    - If you are playing instead of discarding don't worry about them picking it up:
        - your hand score - (their hand score + remaining) > 0
- Keeping track is more important late game

What to do if there are no safe cards to discard?
- Prioritise species
    - what gives them the fewest points/risks the least of yours?
        - Check if they can make a path using it
    - Remove lowest card
- If early game and still building chain, keep the next cards in the chain
- 7s are sometimes better to keep than 8s if you think they have the 1




## 1
Look at hand:
- I have 2 O and 2 M
- They played W2 and discarded M1 so could pick it up
- I have an W3 so could build a defence
- Draw 1 from deck to help decision
- Another O
- Draw from their discard to build M
Play:
- Choose a middle number to begin chain
- I have all numbers except 8 so start with O5
Discard:
- Want to keep the Os and Ms and maybe the W3
- Cards left are R1, J7
- Haven't seen either colour yet, J7 feels more useful
- Discard R1

## 2
Draw:
- They played another W so we want to prevent that
- Want to continue to build the chain
- They've discarded the R1 so could pick it up but it doesn't seem like a threat
- Draw from M6 from deck
- Seems like we can focus on M
- Draw from deck again
- Draw J6, we now have J6 and J7 so might be able to play with them
Play:
- Continue chain with a 4 or a 6
- Change up colours so we don't provoke opponent
- They know we picked up M1 so perhaps we shouldn't play M4 or M6 just yet
- Other option is J6 - We don't have any feelings about J yet so can use it freely
Discard: 
- If we commit to rainbow-chain, we only need a high and a low card for each species,
so can discard M2 as we have M1, M4, M6
- However M4 is the only 4 to continue the chain so we need to hope there
are enough Ms left for us to score

## 3
Draw: 
- They've played M7 so we don't need to be as worried about M just yet
- Still don't need the R1 from their discard
- M2 from our discard might be useful but not yet
- Draw M3 from deck
- Extra M means we don't need to take the M2
- Draw the W7
- We have 10W in hand, they could have 16W so still need to keep the W
Play:
- Continue building chain with 4 or 7
- I like to keep 7s as they can't be cancelled by 1s
- Play the M4
Discard:
- Now discard feels less obvious
- I want to keep Ms and Os for my scoring, and the Ws to prevent their scoring
- So could discard the J7 despite it being a 7
- Discard J7

## 4
Draw:
- They've played an R3 and now picked up the J7
- We could pick up the R1 to throw off their potential R path
- We still don't need our M2 so we can draw from the deck first
- Draw O1 from the deck
- Although, perhaps we should reclaim the M2 to prevent them from
making a path - currently it seems like we will win the M with 1 and 6
- Draw O8 from deck
Play:
- We now have a guarenteed O win with 22 to potential 9
- We can afford to play O1 and O8 and keep the O6 and O7
- However we need a 3 or a 7 for the next chain
- We have an M3 we can use
- Play M3
Discard:
- So we definitely keep all the Os
- Options are, W3, W7, M1, M6
- We're scoring with the M, preventing them from scoring with W
- If we gave them W3, they couldn't improve their current path immediately
(they could if they have another W between 3 and 8)
- Discard W3

## 5
Draw:
- They've played an R8 making a 3 point R path so we could consider the
R1 in their discard, however the R8 is in their playArea so the R1 won't 
have its full effect
- We can draw 1 from deck to see
- Draw C6 from deck
- New colour we haven't seen yet
- Doesn't alter if we want M2 or R1 from discards.
- Draw M2 to fill chain
Discard:
- We're still focusing on O, W, and M.
- Discard C6

## 6
Draw:
- They've drawn the C6 and the R1, they now have a 6 point
R path
- Can now prioritise R over W, so can also use the W7 in our path
- Draw O3 from deck
- Now the most O they can have is 6 to our 25
- We can play all but 6 and maybe 3
- So can now use the O7 to increase chain and keep the W7
- Draw C4 from deck
Play:
- O1 to finish one end of chain
Discard:
- They already have the C6 but they don't have any paths of C yet
- Discard C4

## 7
Draw:
- They've played the C8, they have the C6 so could start a path
- Perhaps we should redraw the C4 in our discard
- They've also discarded the W3 which would bolster our W
- We would have 10 to a potential 13 to prevent 3 points
- Both would prevent 3 points, W seems more likely
- Draw W3
- Draw M8 from deck
Play: 
- We now can win M if we keep the 6 so we can play 1 and 8
- Continue building using cards we can spare
- We need a 7 and the options are W7 or O7
- W7 we need to try and prevent their path
- O7 is spare
- Play O7
Discard:
- We care about W the least so discard either W3 or W7
- Discard W3

## 8
Draw: 
- They've played C5 so now have a 3 point path
- They've discarded a C3 as well
- We will most likely draw to discard
- Could try and prevent their C by drawing both C4 and C3
- W3 is protecting the C4 in our discard but both are worth
the same points
- Draw C3
- Draw W3 by mistake lol
Play:
- O8 to finish O chain
Discard:
- W3 or C3
- Discard W3

## 9
Draw:
- They picked up both W3 and C4
- They played C4 so have a 5 point C line, with our C3 would become
a 10 point path so must keep the C3 and hope their C6 is wasted
- Could play their J3 later
- Draw J3 from their discard
- Draw R5 from deck
Play:
- Chain is complete 1 to 8
- Need to place other cards to create full chains
- M1 and M8 are free to place
- Play M1
Discard:
- Their best current path is a 6 point R so should keep the
R5
- Our C3 would change their C from 5 points to 10 so must keep
it
- W7 only prevents 3 points currently
- J3 could get us 4 points but we know they have the J7
- Discard J3

## 10
Draw:
- They've played W3 increasing W from 3 points to 4
- They've discarded the J3
- Might as well draw from deck
- Draw J5 from deck
- What are the points from each card?
- If I get J3 and play it and somehow win J it's 4 points
- If I draw deck and get a good R it's 6 points off them
- Draw J2 from deck
Play:
- M8 to finish chain
- Play next to M4 instead of O7 for max points
Discard:
- Need to keep O3, O6, M6 for scoring
- Need to keep R5 in hope of preventing their R
- C3 unlikely but prevent their C
- J2 not preventing anything
- Discard J2

## 11
Draw:
- They've played R4 but not increased score
- They've drawn J2, and J3 then discarded J2
- Draw O2 from deck
- Can discard O2 for free
- Draw C1 from deck
- they have played C8 so not powerful
Play:
- Must keep, M6, O6, O2 or O3, W7, R5
- Left is J5, C1, C3
- C: we have 4, they have at least 6, 9 unknown
- J: We have 5, they have 10, 12 unknown
- We play C3
Discard:
- J5

## 12
Draw:
- They've played R7 to no extra points
- R: We have 5, them ?, 8 unknown
- J still no threat
- Draw C7 from deck
- Draw W5 from deck
Play:
- We are not working to any path, just aiming to win hands
- Card we don't need but don't want them to have
- W: we have 12, remaining: 11, ourscore: 0, their: 5
- R: we have 5, remaining: 8, ourscore: 0, theirScore: 7 
- O: we have 11, remaining: 4, our: 11, their: 0

- M: we have 6, remaining: 5, 13, 0
- C: we have 8, they have 6, remaining: 2, 0, 5
- 
- So can spend, O2, O3
- So play O3, can't let them get O3 but could O2
Discard:
- If we discard O2, they can equal our O2 but not beat us
- They have no O path so it's fine
- Others we hope to draw better cards

- M: we have 6, remaining: 5, 13, 0
