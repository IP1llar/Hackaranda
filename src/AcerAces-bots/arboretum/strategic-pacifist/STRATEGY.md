# Strategic Pacifist Bot - Strategy Implementation

This bot implements a 6-process strategic approach to playing Arboretum, written in TypeScript.

## Process 1: Build Initial Mixed Structure
**Implementation**: `play.ts` - First Play Logic
- When placing the first card, chooses middle-ranked cards (closest to 4.5)
- Prefers drawing from deck for variety in early game
- Creates a foundation that doesn't commit to any single species

## Process 2: Access Hand for High-Scoring Potential
**Implementation**: `helpers.ts` - `analyzeHand()` function
- Analyzes hand to identify species with highest scoring potential
- Calculates total rank, presence of 1s and 8s for each species
- Used by both draw and discard strategies to make informed decisions

## Process 3: Categorize Cards (Save vs Play)
**Implementation**: `helpers.ts` - `categorizeCards()` function
- Sorts species by scoring potential
- Keeps top 2 species for saving (to earn right to score)
- Balances save cards to avoid over-accumulation
- Prioritizes play cards for building paths

## Process 4: Handle 1/8 Interaction
**Implementation**: `helpers.ts` - `checkOpponentOnes()` and discard logic
- Detects when opponent has 1s that would nullify our 8s
- Prioritizes playing/discarding useless 8s
- Prevents wasting valuable hand space on nullified cards

## Process 5: Strategic Positioning
**Implementation**: `play.ts` - `calculateBlockingPenalty()` function
- Evaluates placement impact on potential single-species paths
- Gives bonuses for adjacent same-species cards
- Applies penalties for blocking potential paths
- Preserves opportunities for future draws

## Process 6: Game Acceleration
**Implementation**: `helpers.ts` - `shouldAccelerateGame()` and draw logic
- Calculates position strength vs opponent
- Accelerates game by drawing from deck when ahead
- Slows game by drawing from discards when behind

## File Structure

### TypeScript Source Files
- `handleMove.ts` - Main entry point, routes to appropriate strategy
- `draw.ts` - Implements processes 1, 2, and 6 for drawing decisions
- `play.ts` - Implements processes 1, 3, and 5 for placement decisions  
- `discard.ts` - Implements processes 2, 3, and 4 for discard decisions
- `helpers.ts` - Shared utility functions for all strategies
- `types.ts` - TypeScript type definitions
- `readLine.ts` - Console I/O handling
- `index.ts` - Application entry point

### Configuration Files
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
- `package.json` - Dependencies and build scripts
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration for deployment

### Build Output
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript files (generated by TypeScript compiler)

## Key Features

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Changes approach based on game position
- **Hand Management**: Balances saving vs playing cards intelligently
- **Path Preservation**: Avoids blocking potential single-species paths
- **Opponent Awareness**: Considers opponent's hand when making decisions
- **Position Evaluation**: Calculates relative game strength for timing decisions

## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build TypeScript to JavaScript
npm run build

# Run the bot
npm start
```

The bot combines these processes to create a balanced, strategic approach that adapts to the game state while maintaining long-term scoring potential, now with the added benefits of TypeScript's type safety and better development experience.
